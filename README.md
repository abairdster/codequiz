## Beta application for future projects

-This was a very difficult project. Tried to incorporate all requirements, fell short. 
-Building this project helped solidfy some skills but I have a long way to go. I'm looking forward to it.
-Provides a quick submit form for the user to provide information.
-An application like this is a great way to grab and store information.
